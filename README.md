# EDA-Airbnb

# New York City is amid a housing crisis as demand for housing outpaces the city‘s supply. In fact, since 2020, the city’s supply has been steadily falling. Additionally, since 2022, the city’s rent has risen sharply alongside the housing decline. 

# Airbnb Arbitrage occurs when a single host (individual or company) leases out many (10+) different Airbnb units.

# This project intends to answer 4 Questions regarding the effect of arbnb and its arbitrage on NYC's housing market:

# 1. Is NYC’s population increase outpacing the increase in available housing, which causes a housing shortage?
# 2. Are hosts with 10+ properties increasing in NYC, which causes arbitrage?
# 3. Are there any associations between Airbnb arbitrage and housing prices?
# 4. Does this association vary across boroughs of different income levels?
